# ci-cd-practices

## Quick Start

1. Use `gh` CLI for GitHub operations (PRs, issues, actions)
2. Use `kubectl` for Kubernetes inspection and debugging
3. Set reasonable CI timeouts (20 minutes default)

## Key Principles

- Operational tools: gh, kubectl
- Inspect before acting (check PR status, pod logs)
