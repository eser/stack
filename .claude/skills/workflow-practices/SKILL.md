# workflow-practices

## Quick Start

1. Read codebase -> Create todo list -> Check plan -> Execute
2. NEVER revert user changes or overwrite intentional code
3. Do NOT create git commits unless explicitly requested
4. Respect project's tooling decisions

## Key Principles

- Work WITH user changes, not against them
- Fully implement all functionality (no placeholders)
- Be concise, minimize prose
- If uncertain, say so

## References

See [rules.md](references/rules.md) for complete conventions.
