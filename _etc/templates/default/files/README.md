## Features

- Built on [Deno](https://deno.land). So it supports Modern Web APIs.
- Transpiles [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
  [React JSX](https://reactjs.org/) out of the box.

Clone this git repo `git clone https://github.com/eser/cool.git` - and checkout

**Important**: local env files (i.e., `.env.local`) is git-ignored, so you can
have secret your sensitive environment variables by creating local copies of
environment variables before running the service.
