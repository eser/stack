# Fresh vs Lime Framework Comparison Matrix

## Critical Architectural Difference

### JSX Runtime Strategy - View-Agnostic Like Astro

**This is the most fundamental difference between Fresh and Lime:**

- **Fresh**: Tightly coupled to Preact. The entire framework is built around
  Preact's virtual DOM, components, and rendering system.
- **Lime**: View-agnostic framework (like Astro) that treats React, Preact, and
  other libraries as adapters.

#### Lime's View-Agnostic Architecture:

1. **Adapter Pattern**: React and Preact are just adapters, not core
   dependencies
2. **Multi-Framework Support**: Can use different frameworks in the same app
   (React for some islands, Preact for others)
3. **React 19 Features**: Full support for React Server Components (RSC) and
   Server Actions
4. **JSX Runtime Flexibility**: Uses `@eser/jsx-runtime` as a base with
   pluggable implementations
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Can render static HTML with selective hydration
   using any framework

This means Lime can:

- Run React Server Components alongside Preact islands
- Support React 19's Server Actions for form handling and mutations
- Mix and match frameworks based on component needs (React for complex state,
  Preact for lightweight interactions)
- Support future view libraries (Vue, Solid, Svelte) through adapters
- Render pure HTML with no JavaScript when needed

export default function InteractiveChart() {}

// Preact Island
// component.adapter = 'preact'
export default function LightweightToggle() {}

// Static HTML (no hydration)
// component.adapter = 'static'

- Implement Partials system
- Port essential middlewares
- Enhance development experience

### Phase 6: Polish & Extensions

- Add more adapters (Vue, Solid)
- Implement testing utilities
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation and examples

## Technical Decisions to Maintain

### Lime's Core Values to Preserve

1. **View-Agnostic Design**: Treat ALL view libraries as adapters (like Astro)
2. **React 19 First-Class**: Full support for Server Components & Actions
3. **Multi-Framework Islands**: Allow mixing frameworks in one app
4. **Module-based Architecture**: Keep the module system as the foundation
5. **Dependency Injection**: Maintain DI as a core feature
6. **Event-Driven Design**: Keep the event system
7. **Configuration Flexibility**: Support multiple config formats
8. **Standards Compliance**: Continue using @eser packages
9. **JSX Runtime Flexibility**: Keep the pluggable JSX runtime approach

### Fresh Features to Adapt (Not Copy)

1. **Routing**: Adapt file-based routing to work with modules
2. **Islands**: Implement Islands architecture that works with both React and
   Preact
3. **Middleware**: Bridge Fresh-style middlewares with Lime modules
4. **Context**: Merge Fresh's Context with Lime's State
5. **Build System**: Enhance existing bundler with Fresh's optimizations
6. **SSR**: Implement SSR that supports both React and Preact rendering

## Compatibility Considerations

### API Compatibility Goals

- Support Fresh-style route handlers where possible
- Allow Fresh middleware to work with adapters
- Maintain similar file structure conventions
- Compatible TypeScript types for easy migration

### Breaking Changes to Accept

- Different core runtime (AppRuntime vs App)
- Module-based vs file-based configuration
- DI-based state vs context-based state
- Different JSX runtime implementation

## Implementation Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Multi-Framework Islands

- **Problem**: Different hydration methods for React, Preact, etc.
- **Solution**: Adapter pattern with framework detection
- **Implementation**: Each adapter provides its own hydration strategy

### Challenge 2: React Server Components Integration

- **Problem**: RSC requires special bundling and streaming
- **Solution**: Integrate React's RSC bundler with Lime's build system
- **Implementation**: Use React 19's built-in RSC support with custom
  integration

### Challenge 3: Mixed Framework Routing

- **Problem**: Different frameworks in the same route tree
- **Solution**: Route-level adapter configuration
- **Implementation**: Tag routes with their required adapter

### Challenge 4: Server Actions Security

- **Problem**: Server Actions need secure RPC implementation
- **Solution**: Use React 19's built-in security with additional validation
- **Implementation**: Integrate with Lime's middleware for auth/validation

### Challenge 5: Bundle Optimization

- **Problem**: Multiple frameworks increase bundle size
- **Solution**: Smart code splitting per adapter
- **Implementation**: Separate bundles for React/Preact islands

## Conclusion

Lime's vision is to become a truly view-agnostic framework like Astro, where
React, Preact, and other libraries are just adapters. By adopting Fresh's proven
patterns (routing, islands, SSR) while maintaining Lime's architectural
advantages (modules, DI, events) and adding cutting-edge features like React
Server Components and Server Actions, Lime can offer:

1. **Ultimate Flexibility**: Use React for complex interactions, Preact for
   performance, or mix both
2. **Modern Features**: Full React 19 support with RSC and Server Actions
3. **Performance**: Choose the right tool for each component (heavy React vs
   light Preact)
4. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new framework adapters as the ecosystem evolves
5. **Developer Experience**: Fresh's great DX with more framework choices

This positions Lime as the most flexible and modern web framework, combining
Fresh's simplicity, Astro's flexibility, and Next.js's React 19 features in a
single, cohesive platform.
